#### Overview
1. 3 levels, 2 testgrounds.
2. Player can switch between available heroes.
3. Each hero has different movement speed, number of jumps, weapons, attack and defense skills.
4. There are AI enemies roaming around the level.
5. They will pursue and attack player if the player is in their sight radius.
6. Player always can pause the game, go to the start menu and choose a level or a testground to play.
7. Input devices: Keyboard and Mouse, Gamepad (I've tested on Xbox360 controller).

##AI (Artificial Intelligence)
1. Hero will mark target (ally or enemy) according to his own sight radius.
2. Every hero can be a leader. If the hero is not a leader, he will be searching for a leader. When the leader is found, hero follows.
If the enemy appears, he attacks.
3. AI hero will use random attack skill when attack distance is reached.
4. AI hero will use random defense skill as soon as his Health reaches the critical level.
